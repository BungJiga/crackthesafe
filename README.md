# Crack the Safe Project

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, the Math Library to generate a random choice, and conditionals to determine the winner.

## Day 1

#### Planning
- [ ] Complete the project planning document.
#### Set-Up
- [x] Go to the repository at https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/rockpaperscissors
- [ ] Fork this repository to your github account and clone to a new workspace
- [ ] Add, commit, and push your changes
- [ ] Make your site live on gh-pages

### HTML
- [ ] Add any more HTML elements you will need to the page

### JavaScript
- [ ] Add a click handler that displays the value of each number input within the div with the id `#userChoice`

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!
- [ ] Save and submit your website using the link on the Daily Session Document.

## Day 2

### Javascript 

- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare 4 variables (randomNumber1, randomNumber2, randomNumber3, randomNumber4) and generate a random number for each variable. Be sure to save these as strings though! 
- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare 4 variables (numberGuess1, numberGuess2, numberGuess3, numberGuess4) and assign them values of empty strings
- [ ] Outside of your click handler, declare 2 variables (numbersCorrect, numbersInPlace) and assign them values of 0
- [ ] In your click handler, store each input value in the corresponding numberGuess variable
- [ ] In your click handler, display each input value in userChoice
#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [ ] Write a conditional statement that compares each number to see if the number is correct for that position and to see if the number is correct for any other position
- [ ] Display the amount of correct numbers, and how many numbers were in the correct place
- [ ] If the correct code was entered, display a message to the user letting them know they won


#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Projects Extensions:
- [ ] Style the page to fit your personality
- [ ] Validates input so that it will return “Not valid input” if the user types in a wrong choice. 
- [ ] Keeps track of number of guesses
